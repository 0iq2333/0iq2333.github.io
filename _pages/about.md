<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px">I'm a master student in <a href="https://cse.seu.edu.cn/" style="font-weight: bold;">computer science at Southeast University</a>.
<br>
<br>
I received a B.S. in computer science from <a href="https://ccec.nefu.edu.cn/" style="font-weight: bold;">Northeast Forest University</a>, where I joined an ACM team called "The Science of Brute Force"(吾有一术，名曰暴力) with <a href="https://www.yilantingfeng.site/" style="font-weight: bold;">Shichao Jiang</a> and Zhe Zhang, and participated in a series of very interesting algorithmic competitions for two years.
<br>
<br>
My research interest mainly lies on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Federated learning</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Distributed optimization under communication contraints</span>.
<br>
I am a lover of life and love experiencing the good things with my friends! Feel free to share interesting things about academia and life with me!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
